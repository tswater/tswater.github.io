### Ah still drafting here is a bunch of random ideas:
Talk about EWB; how peopleâ€™s own culture and use expectations may not align with the dominant narrative and therefore need to be brought up and elevated 
	How to apply to the classroom? Continual education putting in the work myself
Talk about how this needs to be balanced by work by the  non-marginalized because we should not require additional (un-rewarded) service from traditionally marginalized populations; include personal example of being asked to serve as a queer representative

Bring in diverse voices to class (example; guest speakers EWB?)

Avoid preferential attention in classroom (explicitly alternating who you call on)

Increase awareness of resources (esp scholarship) for minority individuals

Minimize implicit bias by grading as blindly as possible (something I have done) and with clear objective rubrics (example? Perhaps make one for lab)

Pride flag in office; when people meet want them to feel comfortable (example with self)
Make allyship clear without drawing attention to myself

Privileged networking; avoid it!
