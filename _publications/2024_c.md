title: "Generalized Monin Obukhov Similarity Theory for Complex Terrain and Canopies"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024_c
excerpt: 'By leveraging the anisotropy of tubulence, a new form of MOST scaling applicable in complex and flat terrain can be found. This work shows generalized MOST readily applies to canopies, and explores traditional and generalized MOST performance across a wide range of time, place, land cover, anisotropy, and complexity'
