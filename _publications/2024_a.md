**Abstract**
Earth system models currently struggle to account for the complex effects that land surface heterogeneity can have on land-atmosphere interactions. There have been attempts to include the impact of this heterogeneity on the atmosphere, but they ignore the development of coherent circulations that can be driven by spatial differential surface heating. A wealth of literature, particularly large-eddy simulation (LES) based studies, shows that these circulations have significant impacts on the development and organization of clouds. In this work, we describe a two-column model with a parameterized circulation driven by atmospheric virtual potential temperature profiles, differences in near surface temperature between the two columns, patterns of surface heterogeneity, and the mean background wind. Key aspects of the proposed model structure are compared with LES output, and the model is then implemented between two otherwise independent single column models. While some avenues for improvement exist, when the circulations are parameterized, we see increased cloud development and realistic changes to the mean profiles of temperature and moisture. The proposed model qualitatively matches expectations from the literature and LES, and points to the potential success of its future implementation in coarse grid models.
