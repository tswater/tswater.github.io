title: "Impact of Heterogeneity on Scalar Flux Variance Relations Across Diverse Ecosystems"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025_c
excerpt: 'This work emphasizes three forms of heterogeneity related to significant deviations from traditional exchange: spatial heterogeneity of the scalar (carbon, water, heat) sources, anisotropy of the Reynolds stress tensor, and non-stationarity of the timeseries. All three metrics have a unique relationship with the flux-variance relations, and accounting for them yields significant improvements in performance...'
