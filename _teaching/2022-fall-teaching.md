Served as a TA for an introductory course in fluids, teaching and leading the laboratory section of the course

Course Description
======
An introductory course in fluids; students learn the fundamental properties of static and flowing water and other itroductory topics in fluid mechanics including Navier-Stokes equation

Responsibilities
======
Setup and led 5 laboratory sections exploring: surface tension, viscocity, bernoulli's principle, sub-critical/super-critial flow and hydraulic jumps, and transition from laminar to turbulent flow
Graded assigments, laboratory reports and answered student questions in office hours

Evaluations
======
This was a small course (13 students). Anonymous evaluations collected assessed 4 questions on my performance on a scale of 1-5 with 5 as the highest. I recieved photocopies of the evaluations which are included below.

### Selected Comments from evaluations:
* "Tyler teaches for learning and understanding rather than assignment completion. In office hours he would challenge me to fully understanding the background knowledge, concepts and applications of the questions"
* "One of the best TAs I've had at Duke" (recieved 3 times)
* "... he gave criticism that I could actually use to improve and get better grades in the future"
* "I struggled to follow along with the material in class quite often especially when we got caught in the weeds with math. Tyler was very helpful in providing a broader scale understanding of concepts and then translating those to the application on homework"
* "he did not make me feel bad about being confused like other TAs have done"
* "He is friendly and approachable but also is always focused on the task at hand"
* "Tyler actively sought to help out students with homework and lab assignments and made questions into eager conceptual learning opportunities"

### Below are the questions and average score recieved:

Q1: (4.77/5) What was your TA's level of knowledge of the course material?

Q2: (4.92/5) Compared to other TAs you have had at Duke, how would you rate this TA?
